        <p>Our goal is to distribute the relief among those people who are in disaster prone areas
through our web services. Our platform is really handy when it comes to donations,
allowing people to easily donate for those who were deprived from relief services. We
will provide secure services. For this case, We will ensure that all the services and
donations are going to the authentic applicant.</p>
